\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
	A short abstract of what your proposal is about. This is your elevator pitch
	for what this project is about and why it is interesting. This should be no
	more than 3 sentences. Typically you write this last.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}

\textit{This is a template for your project proposal which, by the way,
	is very similar to the template for your final report. It's also pretty
	standard template used for conference and journal publications. For the
	project proposal, however, your context in each section will be shorter
	and preliminary. In other words it is likely to change for the final
	report.
	\textbf{Remove all these italicized instructions before submitting.}}

\textit{The introduction is where you motivate the problem you are trying
	to solve. You should give a brief overview of the problem and why it is
	important. You should also give a brief overview of your approach and
	why it is interesting.}

Introduction text here.

\section*{Related Work}

\textit{This is where you give a brief overview of any prior work by
	others (or yourself) that is relevant to the problem and solution you
	are proposing. For the proposal you should do a preliminary literature search
	and cite any papers using the citation and bibliography syntax illustrated
	below.}

\textit{A comment on related work. You may find a paper or project that
	directly solves the problem you are proposing. Did they also release code and
	models? If not, is there value in reproducing their results and releasing
	code and the model?
	If they did release the code and the model, is it possible to build
	on their work directly and improve it?}

Related work text here. This also shows how put a single
citation \cite{citation_key1} or also multiple citations
\cite{citation_key1,citation_key2}.  The bibliography is embedded
in this \LaTeX \hspace*{1pt} file.


\section*{Proposed Work}

\textit{This is where you describe your proposed solution to the problem.
	This is just the project proposal so at this point this is your best
	guess, but you should try to elaborate on why you think your approach is
	a promising one. Of course this will all evolve as you progress.}

Proposed work text here.

Here is also an example of how to render math inline
such as \(f(x) = \phi_0 + \phi_1 \cdot x\). Or you can render it as a block

\[
	f(x) = \phi_0 + \phi_1 \cdot x
\]

or even numbered
\begin{equation}
	f(x) = \phi_0 + \phi_1 \cdot x.
\end{equation}

\section*{Datasets}

\textit{As part of the feasibility assessment for your project proposal
	you should identify datasets that can use to train and evaluate your
	models. Or if you are doing a dataset project, describe the dataset you
	want to create and the approximate steps and timeline. If it is a theoretical
	or algorithmic project, dscribe any datasets you may need in support of
	that.}

Dataset text here.

\section*{Evaluation}

\textit{Describe how you will evaluate your proposed solution. What metrics
	will you use? What kind of results do you expect to see? Will you be able
	to establish a baseline from existing solutions?}

Evalutation text here.

\section*{Timeline}

\textit{This is a time bound project given the entire course is 14 weeks.
	The proposal deadline is about 3-4 weeks into the course, so you have
	about 10-11 weeks to complete your project if you start after the proposal
	deadline. You should break this down into
	milestones and deliverables. Note that you can set discovery based milestones if
	subsequent steps depend on the results of previous steps. The important
	goal is to gain confidence in the feasibility of the project.}

Timeline text here.

\section*{Conclusion}

\textit{Summarize your proposal and what you hope to accomplish.}
